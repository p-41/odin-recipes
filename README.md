This is a readme file edited in Vim.
Although, this is going to serve as just something to track my progress as I build this project, I think it would be fun to learn some handy vim commands as well at the same time.
I'm supposed to build a website with a recipe so I'll probably keep it simple. 
The easiest and simplest dish I know. Omlette du(au) fromage.

Update: Learned how to create multiple pages and add images and text with formatting along with ordered and unordered lists. Also, had to look up how to resize a picture cause the ones I'd downloaded were occupying pretty much the entire screen. But seems like for the purposes of this assignment, there's not much else left to do.

Also,  Still using vim to edit this text in terminal which is very cool tbh and Id love to learn more. Not sure if I'm supposed to use this file like a personal diary like this lmao but whatever.
