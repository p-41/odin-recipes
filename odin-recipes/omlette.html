    <h2>ELI5 tutorial on how to make a Cheese Omlette. </h2>
    <p><em>(Disclaimer: Your final product will look nothing like the pic above)</em></p> 
    <p>I had to post a recipe here and this was literally the first thing that came to mind and I mean, come on, everybody loves a good Omlette. 
    <p>Although, just to be clear- this particular recipe is a bit Indianised and its how <strong>I</strong> personally like to prepare my omlettes. </p>
    <p>A couple of slices of bread toasted till they're golden brown and slathered with some more butter, a bit of japanese mayo at the side 
    <p>so that I can maybe have half the omlette just as it is and the rest sandwiched between my slices of perfectly toasted golden brown goodness.   
    <p>It's so much more flavorful and it'll also have that little bit of a kick while still being, at the end of the day just a damn good omlette. </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3><em>List of Ingredients -</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 slices of untoasted pre-buttered bread (preferably white, but brown works too)</li>
        <li>some Cheese (just get cheddar or processed or one that melts really well)</li>
        <li>lil block of butter</li>
        <li>lil bit of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>just a pinch of turmeric and paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions -</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Turn on the gas stove and keep the flame low. Place pan on stove. Recite the national anthem of any random country.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Your pan should be sufficiently hot now. Sprinkle some holy water (regular water in case the pan isn't haunted) and wait for the sizzle. </li>
        <li>Step 3: If it sizzled, your pan is haunted. Congratulations! You may now proceed with the omlette making.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Take a spoon, throw it away. Grab a fork, throw that away too. Get a butter knife, and applying very little pressure, smash it right on the center of an egg held horizontally.</li>
        <li>Step 5: If you somehow didn't manage to break the egg and salvage the contents of the egg, make sure its all collected in a nice bowl.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Now get a whisk(or if you're like me and don't have one or are too lazy to look for one, grab the fork you threw away earlier and make it cosplay a whisk.</li>
        <li>Step 7: Beat the eggs till your egg mix looks more or less yellow </li>
        <li>Step 8: Now throw in the lil bit of salt and pepper and just a pinch of turmeric and paprika and mix it some more.</li>
        <li>Step 9: You could obviously add chopped onions or tomatoes but then I'd have to change the title to ELI12 cause toddlers should not handle knives. Unless they have the required license to wield one. </li>
        <li>Step 10: I just realised Step 9 wasn't even a proper step instructing anything. Anyway, exorcise the haunted pan by pouring the spicy egg batter on it.</li>
        <li>Step 11: You'll know when the omlettes ready tbh. Just flip it a couple of times and act like you're shef. Fold it a bit and make some space for your sliced breads. </li>
        <li>Step 12: Once you've made some space for the bread to be toasted, slather some butter on the bread on both sides (And make sure each and every part of the bread gets absolutely smothered with butter)</li>
        <li>Step 13: Go walk around a bit. Stare at your creation wondering why you didn't become a chef instead cause you've clearly got what it takes. </li>
        <li>Step 14: Now carefully place your little omlette baby over one of the slices. Cover it with a cheddar or processed cheese slice blanket. And place the other slice over it. Flip it once.</li>
        <li>Step 15: Transfer your amazing egg sandwich onto the serving plate. Add some ketchup and mayo at the side. Maybe make one of those fancy streaks with a spoon like how they show in Masterchef Australia.</li>
        <li>Step 16: Your omlette is now not ready cause you just made an egg sandwich. Lmao dumbass gotem.</li>
        <li>Step 17: It tastes really good though, doesn't it?</li>
        <li>Step 18: Why is this recipe still going on? </li>
        <li>Step 19: And why are you still here? Its over, your cheese omlette(in a sandwich) is ready.</li>
        <li>Step 20: Okay, you're still here for some reason. But I've got places to be, things to do. Goodbye.</li>
